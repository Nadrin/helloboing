                    "Hello Boing" - Amiga Executable Graphics
                            Decrunch Party, May 2o15


   Hi there!

   This is my first ever prod for the Amiga and kind of a "Hello World" in
   68000 assembly. It will run on any OCS+ Amiga with at least 0.5MB of RAM,
   any version of Kickstart ROM will do.

   Rendering takes about 29 seconds on an unexpanded Amiga 600.

   I release this as an ALLien Senses prod just out of pure nostalgia. The
   group itself remains inactive. It's awesome to finally release something
   new after such a long time. :)

   Special greetings go to Photon/Scoopex for his AsmSkool tutorials!

   Assemble with AsmOne.

   You may do with the code whatever you wish but please credit me if you
   use any of it in your own prod. :)
